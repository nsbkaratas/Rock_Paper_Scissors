This project is a requierement of Perscholas Sofware Engeneering bootcamp.
In this Project I built a Rock Paper Scissors game without that works in the Dom.

## Documentation



  
## Technologies used

This project is built with following technologies:

`HTML5`
`CSS`
`Vanilla Javascript`

    
## Approach taken

- I stated with sketching a wireframe.

- I then created my HTML and CSS using grid according to my sketch

- Finally worked on the javascript. 

- In order to implement some manupulation in the CSS I used Dom manupulation.

  
## Unsolved problems

I would have loved to replace the choices whith each click.

Right now, all the choices are displayed side by side and it doesn't look good.
